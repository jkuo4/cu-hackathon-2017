# How to Beat the Contract Approval Process #

### A data science project done in 15 hours at Columbia Data Hackathon 2017, placed as finalists (top 7 out of 60 teams) 

### Team Members: Adhi Rajaprabhakaran (Michigan State), Jason Kuo (Columbia), Mariel Gahu, and Sharon Tsao (Columbia) 

### 9-22-2017 

After meeting each other and forming a team 5 minutes before the hackathon, we set out to sift through over 20GB of government contract data provided by Enigma. The data contained every contract awarded by the federal government since the year 2000 and varied information about them from the size of the contract to whether the company awarded was owned by a woman or not. Check out our presentation saved as a pdf in the main directory!

### We found that diversity is playing an increasingly important role:
